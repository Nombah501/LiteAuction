# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-02-20)

**Core value:** Run trustworthy Telegram auctions end-to-end with fast operator intervention and clear auditability.
**Current focus:** Milestone closeout after Phase 3 verification sign-off

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 3 (In-Place Triage Interactions)
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase
Status: Phase complete; milestone ready to complete
Last activity: 2026-02-20 - Planning bookkeeping recovered and Sprint 51 status resynced

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 10
- Average duration: n/a (historical data partially reconstructed)
- Total execution time: n/a (recovered from shipped artifacts)

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Dense List Foundations | 3 | n/a | n/a |
| 2. Workflow Presets | 3 | n/a | n/a |
| 3. In-Place Triage Interactions | 4 | n/a | n/a |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-03, 03-01, 03-02, 03-03, 03-04
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 2] Use deterministic preset precedence (admin default on first entry, last-selected thereafter).
- [Phase 2] Enforce preset ownership mutations server-side (owner/admin only).
- [Phase 3] Keep triage interactions to two levels (list + inline details).
- [Phase 3] Require explicit confirmation text for destructive bulk actions.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None; planning state and summaries were recovered to match merged implementation.
