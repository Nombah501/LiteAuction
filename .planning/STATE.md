# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-02-20)

**Core value:** Run trustworthy Telegram auctions end-to-end with fast operator intervention and clear auditability.
**Current focus:** Kick off milestone v1.1 planning and sprint issue scaffolds

## Current Position

Phase: Milestone planning (v1.1)
Plan: Sprint 52 manifest kickoff
Status: v1.1 scoped and ready for issue execution
Last activity: 2026-02-20 - created fresh v1.1 requirements/roadmap and sprint planning manifest

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 30%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 10
- Average duration: n/a (historical data partially reconstructed)
- Total execution time: n/a (recovered from shipped artifacts)

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Dense List Foundations | 3 | n/a | n/a |
| 2. Workflow Presets | 3 | n/a | n/a |
| 3. In-Place Triage Interactions | 4 | n/a | n/a |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-03, 03-01, 03-02, 03-03, 03-04
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 2] Use deterministic preset precedence (admin default on first entry, last-selected thereafter).
- [Phase 2] Enforce preset ownership mutations server-side (owner/admin only).
- [Phase 3] Keep triage interactions to two levels (list + inline details).
- [Phase 3] Require explicit confirmation text for destructive bulk actions.

### Pending Todos

- Execute Sprint 52 items and keep issue/PR traceability current.
- Run sprint sync after manifest changes to refresh `planning/STATUS.md`.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No dedicated GitHub milestone named `v1.0`; delivery traceability currently references Sprint 51 issue lineage.
