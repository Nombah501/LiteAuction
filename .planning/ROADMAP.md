# Roadmap: LiteAuction

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 Operator UX** - shipped 2026-02-20 (Phases 1-3, 10 plans) -> `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`
- 🚧 **v1.1 Adaptive Triage Intelligence** - follow-up execution (Sprint 53, 8/10 met, issues #233-#235 open)

## Next

- Close follow-up for `TELE-02`: exclude failed business outcomes from telemetry sampling, not only auth/validation failures.
- Close follow-up for `TEST-12`: add DB-backed integration coverage for telemetry ingestion and scoped aggregation.
- Run verification refresh and close v1.1 after both follow-up outcomes are complete.
