# Milestone v1.0: Operator UX

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-20
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 10

## Overview

Milestone v1.0 delivered operator speed and context safety in moderation queues: dense-list controls with durable persistence, reusable workflow presets with deterministic defaults, and in-place triage interactions with keyboard and bulk workflows.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Dense List Foundations

**Goal**: Operators can shape queue density, filtering, and table layout for fast scanning with durable persistence.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 01-01: Preference persistence schema and service foundation
- [x] 01-02: Dense controls and queue route integration
- [x] 01-03: Column layout controls and persistence hardening

**Details:**
- Added admin list preference schema, migration, and validation service for subject- and queue-scoped persistence.
- Delivered quick filtering and density controls across moderation queues while preserving qualifier context.
- Implemented show/hide, reorder, and pin column controls with persisted layout restoration.

### Phase 2: Workflow Presets

**Goal**: Operators can save and apply named presets while admins define deterministic context defaults.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 02-01: Workflow preset persistence and policy service foundation
- [x] 02-02: Preset-aware queue routes and deterministic apply/default behavior
- [x] 02-03: Operator save/switch/delete UX safeguards and regression coverage

**Details:**
- Added preset persistence entities and policy layer with ownership validation.
- Implemented deterministic precedence (admin default on first entry, last-selected preset after).
- Completed lifecycle UX coverage for save, update, switch, delete, duplicate-name conflicts, and modified-state guards.

### Phase 3: In-Place Triage Interactions

**Goal**: Operators can inspect and act on queue rows without leaving list context.
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:

- [x] 03-01: Inline disclosure foundation for triage queues
- [x] 03-02: Progressive detail hydration and keyboard interaction layer
- [x] 03-03: Queue-native bulk actions and destructive confirmation flow
- [x] 03-04: Gap closure for focus/scroll restoration, retry hydration, and bulk safety assertions

**Details:**
- Added inline row details with progressive section hydration and retry paths.
- Implemented keyboard-first workflow (`/`, `j`, `k`, `o`, `Enter`, `x`) with focus/scroll restoration.
- Added queue-native bulk actions with per-row outcomes, explicit destructive confirmation, and RBAC/CSRF safety assertions.

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**

- None.

**Key Decisions:**
- Use deterministic preset precedence (admin default first, then last-selected) to avoid operator ambiguity.
- Keep triage interactions to two disclosure levels (list + inline details) to preserve scan speed and context.
- Require explicit confirmation text for destructive bulk actions and retain server-side policy checks.
- Persist dense-list preferences by authenticated subject and queue scope for reliable cross-session ergonomics.

**Issues Resolved:**
- Dense-list ergonomics were unified and persisted across moderation queue surfaces.
- Preset lifecycle edge cases (duplicate naming, ownership boundaries, modified-state transitions) were closed.
- In-place triage now supports progressive details, keyboard flow, and mixed-result bulk outcomes without leaving list context.

**Issues Deferred:**
- `ADPT-01` adaptive detail depth and `TELE-01` preset telemetry moved to next milestone scope.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Phase 2 and Phase 3 summaries were reconstructed retroactively, so task-level counts are not normalized.
- No dedicated GitHub milestone named `v1.0`; delivery traceability currently resides under Sprint 51 issue lineage.
