# Milestone v1.1: Adaptive Triage Intelligence

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-20
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 7

## Overview

Milestone v1.1 extended moderation operator intelligence without sacrificing predictability: adaptive detail depth decisions with transparent reason codes, preset telemetry quality signals, and safety-preserving follow-up hardening for telemetry semantics and integration coverage.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Adaptive Detail Depth

**Goal**: Make row detail depth adaptive by queue risk/priority while preserving deterministic operator navigation.
**Depends on**: v1.0 dense list and in-place triage foundations
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] S52-001: Define adaptive detail depth policy contract
- [x] S52-002: Implement adaptive detail depth in moderation queue UI

**Details:**
- Implemented deterministic adaptive depth selection with explicit `reason_code` and fallback metadata.
- Added per-row operator override controls while preserving row focus, filter, and scroll context.
- Kept disclosure bounded to list plus inline details for scan speed and predictability.

### Phase 2: Preset Telemetry Intelligence

**Goal**: Capture and expose actionable preset quality telemetry for operators and product tuning.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] S52-003: Add preset telemetry event capture and aggregation
- [x] S53-001: Exclude failed business outcomes from preset telemetry sampling

**Details:**
- Added telemetry event capture for queue/preset actions with time-to-action, reopen, and filter churn signals.
- Added segmented aggregation surfaces by queue context and preset.
- Hardened sampling semantics so unauthorized, invalid, and failed action outcomes are excluded.

### Phase 3: Safety and Verification Closure

**Goal**: Preserve moderation safety posture and validate telemetry/adaptive behavior with robust coverage.
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] S52-004: Expose preset telemetry insights in admin workflow surfaces
- [x] S52-005: Harden v1.1 safety and regression coverage
- [x] S53-002: Add DB-backed telemetry ingestion and aggregation integration coverage

**Details:**
- Kept RBAC and CSRF enforcement on adaptive and telemetry mutation/read surfaces.
- Added regression checks for fallback handling and destructive action safeguards.
- Added DB-backed integration tests for telemetry write path and scoped aggregation outputs.

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**

- None.

**Key Decisions:**
- Keep adaptive depth deterministic and transparent with reason/fallback metadata instead of hidden heuristics.
- Treat telemetry as advisory signal only; do not automate moderation decisions from metrics.
- Sample telemetry only from successful business outcomes to avoid misleading quality data.
- Require DB-backed integration coverage for telemetry aggregation confidence.

**Issues Resolved:**
- Adaptive detail depth now responds to risk/priority while preserving queue context and operator control.
- Preset telemetry now supports actionable queue/preset segmentation for operations review.
- Telemetry sampling and aggregation verification gaps identified in early verification were closed in Sprint 53 follow-up.

**Issues Deferred:**
- None at v1.1 closeout.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Local dev environment in this session lacked `pytest`/`ruff`; validation relied on CI checks for execution proof.
