# Sprint 26 - Debug/Triage Foundation

## Goal

Create a repeatable bug triage process before focused bugfix waves.

## Scope In

- Define severity model and triage workflow.
- Standardize bug report fields and reproduction quality bar.
- Define bugfix Definition of Done (DoD) for all follow-up sprints.
- Prepare Sprint 27 candidate queue from known risk areas.

## Scope Out

- No feature work.
- No major refactor.
- No visual redesign implementation.

## Deliverables

- `docs/quality/bug-triage-policy.md`
- `docs/quality/bug-backlog.md`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`

## Exit Criteria

- Every new bug has severity, impact, and deterministic reproduction.
- Bugfix PRs must follow one unified DoD.
- Sprint 27 candidate bugfix queue is ready and prioritized.

## Notes

- This sprint is process-first and intentionally lightweight in code changes.
- Implementation-heavy fixes start in Sprint 27.
